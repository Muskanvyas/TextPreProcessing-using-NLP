This project focuses on sentiment analysis, which involves using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data. The goal is to analyze customer reviews, social media posts, or other text sources to gain insights into public opinion.
Key steps include:
Data collection and preprocessing (cleaning and tokenization)
Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings
Model training with machine learning (e.g., SVM, Na√Øve Bayes) or deep learning (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers)
Model evaluation and optimization
Visualization of sentiment trends
